Please comment me using the following template inspired by Class Responsibility Collaborator (CRC) design:

For the Class part:  State a one line summary. For example, ""I represent a paragraph of text"".

For the Responsibility part: Three sentences about my main responsibilities - what I do, what I know.

For the Collaborators Part: State my main collaborators and one line about how I interact with them. 

Public API and Key Messages

- message one   
- message two 
- (for bonus points) how to create instances.

   One simple example is simply gorgeous.
